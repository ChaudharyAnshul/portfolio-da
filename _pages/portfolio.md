### Text Classification using BERT (Financial Data) 
**Technologies:** LLM models, HuggingFace BERT, Resampling, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Machine Learning     
**GitHub Repository:** [Link to Repository](https://github.com/ChaudharyAnshul/TextClassification)    
-	Achieved a 95% accuracy rate by fine-tuning Transformer-based LLM models (BERT, DistilBERT) for text classification of financial data into predefined classes (Noise, Text, Table)
-	Enhanced model performance by implementing k-fold cross-validation for robustness and applying resampling techniques to address class imbalance in the dataset


### PharmaCutieCal: Drug Side Effect Analysis 
**Technologies:** React, Flask, MongoDB, Machine Learning, Hyperparameter Tuning, Random Forest Classification     
**GitHub Repository:** [Link to Repository](https://github.com/TFC-Civic-Tech-Hackathon/drug-effects-predictor)   
-	Spearheaded the development of a React-based application with a user-friendly UI for capturing medical history and accessing records, integrating a drug input feature and utilizing MongoDB for data storage
-	Implemented a Machine Learning model trained on a dataset of 250k drugs and their side effects to predict potential side effects from user data, developing a Flask-based API for seamless application integration


### Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard 
**Technologies:** Tableau, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Business Intelligence   
**GitHub Repository:** [Link to Repository](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anshul.chaudhary3806/viz/EVDashboard_17195951286360/Dashboard1)  
-	Created an interactive dashboard analyzing over 150,000 electric vehicles, providing insights into market trends and technological advancements
-	Enhanced decision-making by visualizing key metrics, including over 200% increase in BEV adoption and state-wise vehicle distribution from 2020, using dynamic charts and maps
